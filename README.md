"# CarService"



This is my first "big" project, that i wrote with help of my (mid .net programmer) brother. The Idea of this is the information system for a car service, where a user could store and manage data.

It's not fully optimized or finished, but i have learnt a lot while writing this.

We have used C# with .NET Framework, EntityFramework for creating DB, MS SQL to manage entities, LINQ for queries, AutoMapper for DTOs and Ninject for dependency injection.
